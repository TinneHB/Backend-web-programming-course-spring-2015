# Exercise 8: Logical expressions II

Your task is to write logic expressions. First, declare two 
integer variables a and b. Then set a equal to 7 and b equal 
to 12. 

Now write logical expressions for each of the cases below, i.e., 
the expressions must be true when the condition in the case is 
true (and vice versa for false). 

For each case, declare a boolean variable and set it equal to 
the value of the expression, e.g., bool bool1 = ...; 

1. a is smaller than 10 
2. a is larger than or equal to 7 
3. a is not equal to 12 
4. a is smaller than 10 AND a is larger than 5 
5. a is smaller than 10 AND b is not equal to 10 
6. a is larger than 10 OR b is larger than 10 
7. b is in the interval from 0 to 20 AND a is smaller than 8 
8. a plus b is larger than a minus b 

If you have time left, vary the initial values of a and b and 
observe its effects on the results.
