# Exercise 23: Correct change

This exercise is about calculating the correct change when a customer 
pays a due amount with too much cash. 

Suppose a customer has to pay 266 kr but pays 500 kr. The customer 
must then receive 234 kr in return. The tricky part is to figure 
out how to pay back the amount using ordinary bills and coins with 
as few bills and coins as possible. 

In the above case, the correct way to pay back change would be:

  - 1 x 200 kr bill
  - 1 x 20 kr coin
  - 1 x 10 kr coin
  - 2 x 2 kr coins

Within the project there're are no extra classes. The code required for 
solving this problem can be added in the runner.

  1. At the indicated place in code, add code to calculate the correct 
     change. To keeps things simple, we assume that you only use 100 kr 
	 bills, 10 kr coins, and 1 kr coins. Remember to test your code with 
	 different values for change.
  2. If you have time, include more kinds of bills and coins, like 50 kr 
     bills, 5 kr coins, and so on.
