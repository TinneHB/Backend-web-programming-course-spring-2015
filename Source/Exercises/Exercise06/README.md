Your task is to write arithmetic expressions corresponding to the 
below cases: 
 
1. Set a equal to the product of 5 and 7 
2. Set b equal to 25, then increase the value to three times as much 
3. Set c equal to integer division of 16 and 5 (16/5) 
4. Set d equal to 2.5, then divide it by 3.5 
5. Set e equal to b minus a, then multipy that value with c 
6. Set f equal to the remainder after dividing 24 with 6 
7. Set g equal to 35, then divide it by f
