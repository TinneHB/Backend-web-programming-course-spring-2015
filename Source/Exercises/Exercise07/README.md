# Exercise 7: Logical expressions I

The code contains eight logical expressions For each one, 
try to figure out what the value (true or false) of the variable 
is. When ready, see the result by uncommenting the code which
prints the value to the console. 

Uncomment a print statement by removing the initial pair of 
slashes (//): 
 
Change 

    // Console.WriteLine("The value of bool1 is : {0}", bool1); 

to 

    Console.WriteLine("The value of bool1 is : {0}", bool1); 
 
and likewise for subsequent cases.
