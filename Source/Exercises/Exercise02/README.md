# Exercise 2: Find the oldest person in a group of people (no computer involved)

Consider the seemingly trivial problem of finding the oldest person in a group 
of people.

Write down the logic in the form of a series of steps necessary to solve this 
problem in enough detail to make each step trivial. This is perhaps not too hard. 
Now consider how fast your logic is. If it takes one minute to find the oldest 
person in a group of 20 people, how long will it take to find the oldest person 
in a group of 200 people? What about a group of 200,000 people? 

Can you come up with a faster way of solving the problem (Hint: how many 
people are comparing ages in your logic?)
