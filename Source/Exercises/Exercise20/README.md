# Exercise 20: Body analyzer

This project contains a BodyAnalyzer class with a completed 
CalculateBodyMassIndex method plus an unfinished method 
AnalyseBodyMassIndex. The unfinished method compiles, but 
isn't yet implemented.

Your job is to implement the AnalyseBodyMassIndex method. 
The specification is as follows:

  - If the BMI is less than 15, return "You are way too skinny"
  - If the BMI is between 15 and 22, return "You are a bit skinny"
  - If the BMI is between 22 and 28, return "You are just fine"
  - If the BMI is between 28 and 35, return "You are a bit overweight"
  - If the BMI is more than 35, return "You are way too fat"

As always, remember to write code that tests your work.
