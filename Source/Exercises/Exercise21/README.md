# Exercise 21: Counter-controlled while loops

This exercise is about observing how counter-controlled while-loops 
work and then to code a few yourself.

  1. In the WhileLoops.cs file four cases of while-loops (case 1-4) 
     have been implemented. Try to figure out what the output from 
	 each loop will be. When ready, uncomment the line in each loop 
	 that prints the current value of the variable and see if you 
	 were correct.
  2. Following the four cases are four additional cases (case 5-8). 
     Here you have to implement a while-loop to produce the output 
	 given in the comment for each case.
