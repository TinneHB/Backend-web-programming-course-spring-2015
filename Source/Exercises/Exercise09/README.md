# Exercise 9: Observing a class

This exercise is about observing an existing class in action. 

Take a look inside the Car.cs file and how the class is defined.
with constructors, method, etc. Can you figure out what each 
method does? The comments for each method should be helpful. 

Observe the context in which the Car class is used. Make sure 
you understand how:
 
  * Objects are created 
  * Parameters are specified to the constructors 
  * Methods are called 
  * Parameters are specified when calling a method 
  * Return values are used 
 
If you have time left, create a third Car object and call 
methods on it.
