# Exercise 3: Car

The code contains several declarations of variables. All the 
variables represent facts about a car.

1. For each variable, consider if the purpose of it is 
   clearly understandable from its name. 
2. For each variable, consider what actual values it
   can have. Is this consistent with the purpose of the variable? 
3. For each variable, use an assignment statement to assign 
   a value to the variable. Do this in the place indicated 
   by the comments in the code. 
4. Make sure that your program can compile. Press F6 and 
   make sure you get no errors. You'll receive 
   warnings about the variables not being used for 
   anything. Ignore those warnings for now.
