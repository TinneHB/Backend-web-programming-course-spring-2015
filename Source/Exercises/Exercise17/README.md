# Exercise 17: Car with if-statements

This exercise is only about observing how we can use if statements to 
implement business logic. The solution contains a class called Car in 
the Car.cs file.

The Car class contains three methods which use if statements:

  - IsEconomic
  - IsFamilyCar
  - RentalPricePerDay

For each method:

  1. Make sure you understand the possible return values and under 
     what circumstances each value can be returned.
  2. Read the code at the top of Car.cs. It tests the Car class. 
     Before running the program, try to predict the outcome.
  3. Run the program and check that the outcome is as you predicted. 
     If not, you may need to read the code again.
  4. Try to change some of the values used when creating the three 
     Car objects and see if you can predict the outcome of running 
	 the program.
