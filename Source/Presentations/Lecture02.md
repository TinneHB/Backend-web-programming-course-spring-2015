# Lecture 2 notes

- Create a new console application for each exercise

- Variables
- Using C#/VS as an advanced calculator
- Illustration memory/variables with calc.exe
    MC = Memory Clear. Sets memory to 0 
    MR = Memory Recall. Uses number in memory, as if keyed in 
    MS = Memory Store. Puts number on display into memory 
    M+ = Memory Add. Takes number on display, adds it to memory, and puts result into memory 
- TI-83 image search illustrating storage locations L1-L6
- C#
  - Not just one or six locations, but infinitely many
  - Not adressable by predefined L1-L6 mnemonics but any name
  - Not just int or floats, but strings, boolean, lists as well (predefined vs custom types)

- Example
  - What does type and name looks like in C#
  - Declaration and definition (combined into one)
  - Assignment vs. equality operator in math vs. C#
  - Pascal vs. camal case naming convention
  - Prefix, infix, postfix operators and f(x) equivalent
  - Operator precedence and associativity
  - Using Convert class and implicit/explicit conversion
